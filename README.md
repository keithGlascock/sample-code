# sample-code


This is the sample code for personal projects I have worked on.  This is an update.

This is a webpage to show the locations of missing pets in the Peoria, IL area.  The data was stored in a MySQL database on my local computer.  The Google Maps javascript API was used for the map features.  PHP was used to display data to the front end.
